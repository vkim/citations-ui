[1], in which the authors reported promising therapeutic options for treatment of infections caused by colistin-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. The authors observed overall increased antimicrobial susceptibility among colistin-resistant strains,compared with the parent colistin-susceptiblestrains.",references,NOT found in MAS
10.1086~533477,"Because of the potential therapeutic importance of this observation, we evaluated the susceptibility profiles of polymyxinresistant and -susceptible A. baumannii clinical isolates collected as part of the global SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program during the period 2001– 2007 [2]. A collection of 3707 A. baumannii isolates were tested for susceptibility to numerous antimicrobial agents using validated broth microdilution panels with cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton medium (TREK Diagnostics) [3]. Testing and incubation were performed according to the methods of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [4]. MICs were interpreted as specified by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [5], except for tigecycline MICs, which were interpreted according to breakpoints approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (breakpoint for susceptibility, р2 mg/mL; breakpoint for resistance, у8 mg/mL). For comparison purposes, geographically unrelated polymyxin-resistant isolates were included in this study, and the resistance phenotype was confirmed by Etest (AB Biodisk). Susceptibility rates for polymyxin-resistant isolates were compared with those for polymyxin-susceptible isolates by x2 test, using EpiInfo, version3.4.1 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). was considered to be statisP ! .05 tically significant. The distribution of MIC50 and susceptibility rates among polymyxin-resistant and -susceptible A. baumannii for selected antimicrobial agents are shown in table 1. Most drugs demonstrated limited spectrums of activity against the polymyxinsusceptible group (susceptibility rate, р53.8%), except for the carbapenems (imipenem [71.6% susceptible] and meropenem [68.0% susceptible]), tetracyclines (doxycycline [74.6% susceptible], minocycline [88.4% susceptible], and tigecycline [97.0% inhibited at р2 mg/mL]). Overall, compared with the polymyxinsusceptible group, the polymyxin-resistant group showed higher susceptibility rates for the majority of antimicrobial agents (16 of 22 antimicrobial agents). The differences were mostly observed among those drugs showing lower susceptibility rates (р48.8%) and were statistically significant for the b-lactams ampicillin-sulbactam, aztreonam, cefoxitin, cefepime, ceftriaxone, and cefuroxime ( ). In P ! .05 contrast, antimicrobial agents with better activity, such as imipenem, meropenem, tobramycin, minocycline, and tigecycline, showed similar or slightly higher activity against the polymyxin-susceptibleisolates, compared with the polymyxin-resistant isolates. Overall, these results corroborate with those previously reported by Li et al. [1], except for the results for ticarcillin-clavulanate and carbapenems, for which the authors noted substantially lower MICs among the colistin-resistant group, compared with the colistin-susceptible group. On the other hand, compared with our group of polymyxin-susceptible isolates, our collection of polymyxin-resistant clinical isolates showed higher susceptibility rates for amikacin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole—results not observed previously by Li et al. [1]. Li et al. suggested that A. baumannii showing phenotypic resistance to colistin may possess outer-membrane modifications, consequently increasing permeability for antimicrobial agents, which may also explain the results obtained in our study. Regardless of the changes, they were not favorable for those antimicrobial agents frequently used for treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant A. baumannii, such as the carbapenems and tobramycin. Furthermore, minocycline and the novel glycylcycline tigecycline, which may represent a valuable antimicrobial for treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant A. baumannii [6], were highly active independently of the polymyxin susceptibility profile. at Physical Sciences Library on September 1, http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from",references,NOT found in MAS
